# Contributing to `free-to-use-API-list`
Thanks for considering contributing to the project!

## Getting Started
* Fork or clone this repository to your own Github repositories.
* Open using your IDE of choice. I recommend VS Code and using the Github Desktop extension for version control.

## How to Add an API of Your Own
* APis should be added to README.md, should not be a duplicate, and should be placed in alphabetical order.
* Follow the existing format in README.md, which is as:
1. Include an asterisk and single space at the start of the line. This will make a bullet.
2. List the title or name within brackets.
3. Immediately follow the square brackets with the API's link or url in parenthesis.
4. Optionally add a brief description of what the API does.
* An example addition is as follows:
* `* [Made Up API](www.api.madeup.com/) - A fictional API to show an example of an API listing.`
